      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t succeed, try try again. So I decided to try the 100 Days of Code challenge this year. Last year I did it, but only was able to get to Day 56. Not too bad, but I am still not satisfied that I didn&amp;rsquo;t go the distance. Technically I did code almost everyday from May to July, however that was for an internship, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure if I should have counted that.</description>
