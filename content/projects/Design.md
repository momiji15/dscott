I have made some tutorials on R; namely how to collect tweets and to map them on Leaflet. I have some ideas of other 
tutorials, so stay tuned!

# From App to Map
This tutorial was initially created for the Programming for GIS class and was modified for a workshop I did at the We Rise Tech conference which took place in Atlanta, GA in June 2017. The first part of the tutorial goes over collecting tweets using the the TwitteR package and the second part of the tutorial goes over mapping collected tweets in a Leaflet map.

# R Ready to Map
This course goes over mostly the same thing as From App to Map but uses the rtweet package. This course was created using instructional design.  I used a modified version of the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) model in order to make this course. This course is divided into three units which goes over how to collect tweets, display them on a leaflet map, and how to create an R Markdown document and an R presentation. Feel free to use the materials for your workshops or classes, but please give credit where it's due!
