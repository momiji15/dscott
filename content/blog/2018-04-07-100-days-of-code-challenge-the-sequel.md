If you don't succeed, try try again. So I decided to try the 100 Days of Code challenge this year. Last year I did it, but only was able to get to Day 56. Not too bad, but I am still not satisfied that I didn't go the distance. Technically I did code almost everyday from May to July, however that was for an internship, and I wasn't too sure if I should have counted that. For this year's 100 Days of Code challenge, I actually have a bucket list of things to do:


- Do some number crunching for my own research.
- Make my personal site version 3.
- Work on refining a Shiny App.
- Make a Shiny app since I said I would do so for my dissertation.


Last year, I did some of the FreeCodeCamp modules, which involved messing around with JavaScript and HTML but time is of the essence, so I will be exclusively focusing on using R during this period. I am currently on Day 4 and I am trying to get the third version of my website up and running. As much as I like making a web page with HTML and JavaScript, I thought I would give Blogdown a try. It took some getting used to, but I think I am finally getting the hang of things.

On top of all of this, I am also going to do some DataCamp modules on the side. I really like DataCamp because I can at least squeeze in one or two modules when my schedule is out of control. Plus I&rsquo;m a tad bit rusty on Shiny and DataCamp has a nice course on it. I'm also doing the Data Science with R track.

Anyway, I'm not going to say "let's see how this goes" because I really have no choice but to get all of this done!
